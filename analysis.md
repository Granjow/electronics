How to find bugs?

## Oscilloscope

Oscilloscopes measure voltages at a high frequency.
An example for a digital oscilloscope is the [PicoScope](https://www.picotech.com/)
which also offers a Linux GUI.

## Logic Analysers

Logic Analysers are powerful for digital signals.
[SigRok](https://sigrok.org/) together with PulseView can use 24 MHz logic analysers
which can be obtained for less than 10 dollars on Ebay.
