## Design Guidelines

“Productive prototype” experiences:

**Flexible parts** eventually break from usage. Get rid of them if possible.

**Gravity** eventually wins. Plugs which are mounted upside down and which are exposed to vibration eventually disconnect.
Attach them in a different way.

**Status info** e.g. with LEDs is very helpful for debugging on the field. Is the controller broken (signal does not change)
or is the consumer broken (does not react to signal)?

## Breadboard

Cutting wires to the correct length. Strip 6 mm of insulation.
