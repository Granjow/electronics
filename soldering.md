# Soldering


## Soldering DIP ICs

From around DIP-6 and above, consider using DIP sockets which are soldered first.
The IC can then be plugged onto the socket. Benefits: it is not heated while soldering,
and it can easily be replaced if broken or removed/salvaged if not required anymore.


# MOSFETs

Larger MOSFETs have a hole in their heatsink which allows them to be mounted onto an even larger heatsink.
ON Semi provides a in-depth [manual on soldering MOSFETs][onsemi-mosfet], 
and Vishay has [guidelines on handling failed MOSFETs][vishay-mosfet].
